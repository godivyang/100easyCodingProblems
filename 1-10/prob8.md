# **Maximum Subarray**
#### [_(from leetcode)_](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-subarray/)  

### Given an integer array nums, find the contiguous subarray (containing at least one number) which has the largest sum and return its sum.

| Example          | 1                       | 2         | 3   | 4    | 5         |
|------------------|-------------------------|-----------|-----|------|-----------|
| **Input nums:**  | [-2,1,-3,4,-1,2,1,-5,4] | [1]       | [0] | [-1] | [-100000] |
| **Output:**      | 6                       | 1         | 0   | -1   | -100000   |
| **Explanation:** | [4,-1,2,1] has the largest sum = 6. |

## **Constraints:**

**1 <= nums.length <= 3 * 104  
-105 <= nums[i] <= 105**

### **Follow up:** If you have figured out the O(n) solution, try coding another solution using the divide and conquer approach, which is more subtle.
